This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element outside the array's valid index range. This leads to a runtime exception. The solution, `bugSolution.java`, corrects the loop condition to prevent the error.  This example highlights the importance of careful array index handling in Java.
